A software company can be broadly of two types services-based and product-based. I would like to work in a product based company with my batchmates Aryan and Chaitanya. I can look after Database and business solutions to integrate our work together efficiently. Aryan holds a CSE degree with specialization in cyber security and holds experience in penetration testing, web vulnerability testing, SQL injection, cross-site scripting and data vulnerability testing. He can ensure that our network is secure and can also perform software testing. He acn also look after quality assurance. Talking about Chaitanya he is a CSE undergrad and has very proficient skills and work experience in the field of web development.
